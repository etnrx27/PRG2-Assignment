# PRG2-Assignment
Final Assignment to build a program for 'Programming 2' Module Taken in NP Semester 2.
# What is Required
A TraceTogether Program needs to be built from scratch using C#. This assignment is pair-work and the assignment is meant to split into two-halves among the pair. One is meant to do SHN Locations while the other is meant to do the TraceTogether checking in and checking out process. Please refer to the document, "PRG2 Oct2020 Assignment - FINAL" to gain more information about the assignment. 
# My Duties
I was in charge of making the TraceTogether checking in and checking out process. Thus, I did all the basic requirements and advanced requirements for the assignment.
# Important Notes
Some of the SHN Facilities locations options does not work because my partner did not manage to complete it.
